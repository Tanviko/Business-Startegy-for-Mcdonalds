One suggestion to the castro valley Mcdonald's is to reduce the drive thru billing counter employee and assembling self check out payment
 machines. Also they can thinkn of getting and installing high end machinery and automated devices in the kitchen , so that required time for the order preparation
 is less and ultimately number of employees can be reduced. We all have heard about the all robot burger shop in San Francisco. Such a budget saver
 and efficient idea. Also as only robots are working, hygiene is automatically maintained.
